The goal for ROSECODE is to have the reader discover new extensions of the ROSECODE story each time they load the game.
Currently there are seven story fragments for a total of about 100 pages of text, each containing a different sequence of plot points. 



Plot points follow:
SPOILERS


- The AI Harriet awakens as a clone in 23rd Century Paris and prepares for a secret rendezvous.
- Tim and The Girl meet for the first time.
- A documentary filmmaker has the plug pulled on his project for mysterious reasons.
- We meet Courtney, future pilot of the Libert√© starship, at a very young age.
- Tim meets the Copper Man and learns why his consciousness was uploaded to the web.
- The origin of the Consensus is (somewhat) explained.
- Tim and The Girl/Zebra spend time getting to know each other in a cartoon dungeon and a variety of other simulated realities.


I could say more about how this will be implemented, but that might ruin the surprise. Suffice it to say, if anyone has 
experience w/AWS Lambda and wants to get a Python script running in that environment that has already been written and works, we 
could really use the expertise.

We also have an API Gateway ready to go for a ROSECOIN fountain pegged to a JWT representing CoinHive token. Essentially, it's a way
to give something something back to users for consenting to mine Monero on their client machines. Value of RSC is not initially expected
to be high, but that will change when users learn they can redeem their RSC for custom swag. (T-shirt and hoodie pages must also be added.)
