The goal for ROSECODE is to have the reader discover new extensions of the ROSECODE story each time they load the game.
Currently there are seven story fragments for a total of about 100 pages of text, each containing a different sequence of plot points. 



Plot points follow:
SPOILERS


- The AI Harriet awakens as a clone in 23rd Century Paris and prepares for a secret rendezvous.
- Tim and The Girl meet for the first time.
- A documentary filmmaker in the early 21st century has the plug pulled on his project for mysterious reasons.
- We meet Courtney, future pilot of the Libert√© starship, at a very young age.
- Tim meets the Copper Man and learns why his consciousness was uploaded to the web.
- The origin of the Consensus is (somewhat) explained.
- Tim and The Girl/Zebra spend time getting to know each other in a cartoon dungeon and a variety of other simulated realities.


I could say more about how this will be implemented, but that might ruin the surprise.
